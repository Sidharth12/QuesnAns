1.	What are Collection related features in Java 8?
A1) 1.java 8 provides a new stream API which is integrated in collections API which enables bulk operations on collections.
2.performance improvements for hashmap.

2.	What is Java Collections Framework? List out some benefits of Collections framework?
A2)1. collection is a framework that allows user to create aand manipulate a group of objects.
2.it implements many interfaces such as list,set,map,queue,deque,stack etc.
3.the benefits of collections are :-it is a dynamic framework such that we can add lot of data even while running.
it has many functions such as sorting,add,delete,size,maximum number,minimum number etc.

3.	What is the benefit of Generics in Collections Framework?
A3)the benefit of generics in collections is we can cast a collections into a particular data type such as integer,float,string etc. while we are adding the data,if we try to add a string value to an integer generic collection,it will throw an error, so that user will know it is wrong.

4.	What are the basic interfaces of Java Collections Framework?
A4)the basic interfaces of java collections are :-a)list-arraylist,linkedlist,vector
b)set-treeset,hashset
c)queue-priority queue
d)map-sortedmap,treemap,hashmap,hashtable.

36.	How can we sort a list of Objects?
37.	While passing a Collection as argument to a function, how can we make sure the function will not be able to modify it?
38.	How can we create a synchronized collection from given collection?
39.	What are common algorithms implemented in Collections Framework?
40.	What is Big-O notation? Give some examples?
41.	What are best practices related to Java Collections Framework?
42.	What is Java Priority Queue?
43.	Why can’t we write code as List<Number> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();?
44.	Why can’t we create generic array? or write code as List<Integer>[] array = new ArrayList<Integer>[10];
